Spring JPA 
----------
Spring JPA is better than compared to Spring ORM as it is Advanced Model it is also like doing same like object saving in database where we did in hibernate

for this now create a maven project in maven setting catalog as internal
set mavenarchtypequcikstart 1.1 & set Artifact Id as springdatajpa which is nothing but project name

now to do this project we have to add the dependencies from maven repository to pom.xml in the project

springcontext--->5.3.31
hibernate-core-->5.6.15
MySQL connector-->8.3.0
spring data jpa-->2.7.18
lombok-->1.18.42
