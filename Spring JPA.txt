Spring JPA 
----------
Spring JPA is better than compared to Spring ORM as it is Advanced Model it is also like doing same like object saving in database where we did in hibernate

for this now create a maven project in maven setting catalog as internal
set mavenarchtypequcikstart 1.1 & set Artifact Id as springdatajpa which is nothing but project name

now to do this project we have to add the dependencies from maven repository to pom.xml in the project

springcontext--->5.3.31
hibernate-core-->5.6.15
MySQL connector-->8.3.0
spring data jpa-->2.7.18
lombok-->1.18.42

------------------------------------------------------
in this we don't need to write dao layers of 2 files like dao file and daoimpl file instead of that we create the repo package and in that we create this interface of the below code

package com.codegnan.repo;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

import com.codegnan.entity.Student;

@Repository
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Integer>{

}
